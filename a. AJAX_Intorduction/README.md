# JavaScript AJAX Introduction

### AJAX is a developer's dream, because you can:

#### Read data from a web server - after the page has loaded.

#### Update a web page without reloading the page.

#### Send data to a web server - in the background.


## What is AJAX?

Ans:

1. AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript And XML.

2. AJAX is not a programming language.

3. AJAX just uses a combination of:

    A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server).

    JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).

## How AJAX Works?

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked).

2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript.

3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server.

4. The server processes the request.
   
5. The server sends a response back to the web page.
   
6. The response is read by JavaScript.
   
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
